# Docker Practice

This project is a simple Node.js application using **Express.js**, containerized with Docker.  
The app exposes a single endpoint `/` that responds with **"Node.js from Docker!"**.  

### What I did
- Wrote a Node.js server (`index.js`) with Express  
- Created a `Dockerfile` to build a custom image using Node  
- Installed dependencies inside the container  
- Built and ran the container locally  
- Pushed the image to Docker Hub
